        You know, I\'ve always been collected, calm and chill
        \nAnd you know, I never look for conflict for the thrill
        \nBut if I\'m feeling someone stepping towards you
        \nCan\'t describe just what I\'m feeling
        \n\nFor you, I\'d go step to a dude much bigger than me
        \nFor you, I know, I would get messed up, weigh 153
        \nFor you, I would get beat to smithereens
        \n\nYou know, I\'ll be in the corner taking notes
        \nAnd you know-ow
        \nI got your six while you\'re working votes
